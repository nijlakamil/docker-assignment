This project was inspired by the need to understand how microservices can be deployed using Docker without Docker Compose. I chose a simple task manager to keep the focus on Docker operations rather than application complexity.

The main challenge was managing container communication without Compose. I solved this by using Dockerâ€™s manual network and ensuring each service was correctly named and networked.

Docker volumes helped retain MongoDB data, even after containers were removed. Healthcheck in Dockerfile was added to monitor backend service.

This application could be improved by adding NGINX reverse proxy for load balancing, using Docker secrets for environment variables, and deploying on cloud providers with automated CI/CD pipelines.
